# Package-Manager
Parcel Tracker is a web application designed to manage and track packages efficiently. Users can search for packages by name or tracking number, update their status (collected/not collected), and view their location on a Google Map integration. The application allows users to add new packages with details such as name, tracking number, and location coordinates. It features sorting options to display packages by collected status or all items. Data retrieval is facilitated through API calls, with state management handled using MobX for seamless updates.
